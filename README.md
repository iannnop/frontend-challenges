## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned that writing a web app based on a design is completely different from following tutorials that lay out all the steps already. At times, I would continuously alt+tab to figure out the differences between my component and the image of the design.


### Continued development

I want to practice more base CSS before deciding to move toward CSS frameworks like Tailwind or using React libraries like Material UI or Chakra UI. I also plan to learn how to make more static pages with React using React Hooks before moving on to dynamic pages with Next.js

### Useful resources

- [Modern CSS Solutions](https://moderncss.dev/) - Reference for modern best practices with css
- [React Tutorial App](https://react-tutorial.app/) - The free practice problems to learn the basics of React help reinforce my understanding of React
- [JavaScriptMastery](https://www.youtube.com/c/JavaScriptMastery) - I learned some naming conventions for CSS like the BEM methodology, which helped me get over slumps of not knowing what classname to use, and I also liked how he declared variables for colors and fonts.
